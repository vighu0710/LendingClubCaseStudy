## General Information
- This case study is to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- Borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
- To analyse this we have the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011 and its Data Dictionary.
